                <p>We designed an imaginative solution to enhance how customers discover 
                and purchase apparel. <br><br>
                The Winners shopping experience is that of a “Treasure Hunt.” We wanted to 
                emphasize this experience through a unique AR application where visitors can search for a variety 
                of randomized promotions in store.</p>

                <p>Visitors will initiate the game by scanning the QR Code at the front 
                    of the store. <br><br>

                   They are prompted for their information and what they are looking for. This lets the 
                   game know where to generate treasure. For example, if they are looking for shirts, the game 
                   will generate treasure in the shirts area.</p>

            <div id="project-text-body">
                <p>As described, our main takeaway was that Winners see their shopping experience as a treasure hunt, 
                which informed the direction of the Winners Treasure Hunt. We took inspiration from Pokemon GO and 
                other 3D navigation apps and games for navigation and motion. We also made sure to reference images 
                of Winners and their online media to determine its visual language.</p>

                <p>Mapping the Store</p>
            </div>
            <p id="project-text-body">We made sure to visit physical Winners Locations to get a sense of the layout in respect to the 
                main clothing areas. We designed a simple layout in Bezi to illustrate this.</p>

            <div id="project-text-body">
                <p>After visiting the stores, we designed a flow that the game would 
                follow intuitively through the store. The whole experience and flow will be discussed in the 
                final deliverables section.</p>

                <p>Next, we created our interface flow and elements for initial game prompts 
                and the two types of wayfinding. We were keen on making sure to iterate on the elements and make 
                sure they are visible in AR against the busy store aesthetics.</p>

                <p>From Pain Point to Selling Point</p>
            </div>
            <div id="project-text-body">
                <p>At the start of the project, our team had initially all seen the Winners 
                shopping experience as a pain point. We disliked how there was no “proper” inventory or collection 
                of items and wanted to design something that would allow visitors to more easily find items they 
                wanted. After further research, we learned that this treasure hunt shopping experience was actually 
                a feature, not a bug. This was the catalyst for how the Winners Treasure Hunt turned out to be in 
                its final form, and we were glad this insight changed our direction.
                <br><br>
                Overall, the Winners Treasure Hunt is an opportunity for visitors to experience shopping at Winners 
                using emerging technologies, while maintaining the surprise factor they know and love. This project 
                allowed me to use my previous digital media skills in After Effects</p>
